Case Study Introduction:

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat — the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

Problem Statement:

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent, and which menu items are their favourite.
Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program — additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

The data set contains the following 3 tables which you may refer to the relationship diagram below to understand the connection.

CREATE TABLE sales (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "order_date" DATE,
  "product_id" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  ("customer_id", "order_date", "product_id")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
 

CREATE TABLE menu (
  "product_id" INTEGER,
  "product_name" VARCHAR(5),
  "price" INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  ("product_id", "product_name", "price")
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  "customer_id" VARCHAR(1),
  "join_date" DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  ("customer_id", "join_date")
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
